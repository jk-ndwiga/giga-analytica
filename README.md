Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

CLV is an important marketing metrics
It measures customers' total worth to the business over the course of their lifetime relationship with the company.
CLV for individual customers helps marketers in justifying their marketing budget
When determining the budget for a marketing strategy, it is essential to know what the expected return will be from running a given marketing campaign.
It also helps in targeting potential high-value customers.
If your marketing spend for new customer acquisition exceeds the CLV, you will lose money for each acquisition so better to work with the existing customers.
